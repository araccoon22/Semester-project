## Comparative analysis of discrete choice models estimation using different software packages

Since their establishment in the field of econometrics, discrete choice models have been extensively used
in many research fields such as transportation, environmental economics, health, energy, marketing, and
others. Currently, there is a plethora of commercial and open-source software that can be used for the estimation
of discrete choice models. Biogeme (Bierlaire, 2003) and Apollo (Hess & Palma, 2019) are two
of the most appealing alternatives, as they are both open-source (based on Python and R respectively) and
cover a broad range of advanced discrete choice models and diagnostics. More recently, other alternatives
have been developed such as mixl (Molloy et al., 2021) and MO|DE.behave (Reul et al., 2023). Given the
differences in the code development and the tools used, this project aims at investigating (a) differences in
performance and computational speed between the two packages, (b) potential differences in the results and
model statistics for the same models and datasets, and (c) available functionalities i.e., what are the common
features and what are the specific features of some packages that are not available in others. Understanding
the pros and cons of each package via this comparative analysis can ultimately lead to more optimised and
accurate software for estimating discrete choice models.
